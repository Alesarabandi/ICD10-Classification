# ICD10-Classification
This project explores the automation of clinical coding—specifically mapping complex, unstructured clinical notes to standardized ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision) codes. On "ZERO_RAG" you would find the model of zero shot llm and RAG-LLM plus the preprocessing,... on the "EMB+DNN" you will find the embedding process and DNN.
